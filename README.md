# website instructions 

For this website the end-user can enter their username, to look up thier current information on the current live ARAM game. The website will return information such as, the username of all participants, and all the champions they are playing. This website will also return the winrate for all champions within the game, to provide the user an idea about wether or not the game is winnable.

To run this code, you need a current valid api key from riot games. Another note, some of the code refers to files with specific local paths and must be changed for the website to function.
